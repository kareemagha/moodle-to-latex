Figure 1. Two charge of equal sign and magnitude $q$ and mass $m$ are connected to a massless string of length $l$. When hung from the same point on the ceiling the two charges repel each other and are separated by a distance $x$. Both masses are at an angle $\theta$  from the negative $y$-axis.\\

\textbf{Part 1)}\\

Use the small angle approximation to derive an expression for the angle $\theta$ (in radians) in terms of $\epsilon_0, l, q, m$ and $g.$ Do not include $x$ in your expression.\\
